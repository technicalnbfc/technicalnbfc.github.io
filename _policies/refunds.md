There are two components of a players registration fee.

- Governing body fees (for both Football Queensland and Football Australia)
- A club fee

North Brisbane FC, like most clubs, does not provide refunds to players for their club fee unless they request de-registration prior to playing a fixture match.

In these cases, a refund of the club component (but not Football Queensland/Football Australia fees) will be given less a $50 administration and a pre-season training/playing fee of $50 per month. If merchandise (polo, shorts and socks) has already been provided the player is required to return that merchandise or have a further $50 deducted from the refund amount.

Any refunds to be given to a player who ceases to play after the start of the fixture season depends on the relevant circumstances. The starting point is that refunds are generally not given due to the sunk costs involved once a player has registered and played games.

Refund of governing body fees are done pursuant to the FQ Refund Policy, i.e. we as a club do not have any control over that.

Players may request a refund in exceptional circumstances, but FQ policy provides that once a player has participated in any form of pre-season training and/or games, they are not entitled to a refund of the governing body fees.

**Important** Where a player is allowed to pay in instalments, the full amount of the registration fee is owing, even if a player decides they do not wish to play anymore.

For any refund enquiries please contact the treasurer via email [treasurer@northbrisbanefc.com.au](mailto:treasurer@northbrisbanefc.com.au).
