To kick off the start of 2019 the website has had a slight refresh, keeping up to date with team, committee, and coaching changes.

As we move forward in 2019 there are a number of big plans pending the outcome of grant applications back in 2018. It's our dream to see the pitch re-surfaced, and update in the IT infrastructure at the club, and more effort put into the club house and aging grandstands.

If you have any great suggestions for something the club couldn benefit from please let us know!
