title: Wrapping up 2019 and looking to 2020
---
 
It's been a great year for the club, with all our big news on our Facebook page.  

We've had some big success on the Grants front:
* Field upgrade
* Installation of perimeter fence
* Installation of additional irrigation line at Swinbourne Street end
* Installation of additional water harvesting point
* Installation of solar panels including battery storage plant
* Installation of new and improved dugouts
* Clubhouse modifications - two additional dressing rooms (subject to approval)
* New goal posts on wheels

There have been some small updates to the website for the 2020 committee members and registration fees. Payments, insurance, and refunds are still to be finalised. 

If you're looking to find something out and it isn't on the website, feel free to get in touch with one of the committee members or via our Facebook page/messenger.

Cheers!
North Brisbane FC Team
