North Brisbane FC is an inner city northside club located at Prentice Park, Thistle Street Lutwyche. Football clubs have operated out of this facility since the 1920s.  

Though various clubs played out of Prentice Park over the post-war years, by the 1960s it became the permanent home of Polonia, a club supported by the Brisbane Polish diaspora. In the early 1970s the club renamed themselves North Brisbane pursuant to a directive from the Queensland Soccer Federation to abolish ethnic names.  

For the most part of the 1960s and 1970s the club played in the first division competition. However, the dwindling of the Polish influence at the club coincided with a downturn in the club’s fortunes. By the mid- 1980s, the Polish influence over the club had largely disappeared. The running of the club was taken over by the junior committee and, to create a point of distinction, was again renamed Lutwyche United.  

After that came a period of remarkable success, with the club going all the way from fifth to first division within six years. To coincide with the opening of licenced premises at Everton Park, the club was again renamed North Brisbane in 1993.  

However, with the licenced club struggling to pay its way, financial constraints forced the club to exit from the then Queensland Soccer Federation competition at the end of the 1995 season, having played the previous 4 seasons in the top flight. Thereafter, the club continued to operate in amateur competitions such as the Commercial League (now QIF) and Christian Soccer.  

In 2015, the club, in association with the New Farm Punjabi community, fielded 2 teams in the Capital Division 4 and Reserves competition.  

Now branded as North Brisbane FC and with a proper committee structure in place, the club has gone from strength to strength. For 2021, we are expected to field 12 teams in senior competition, as well as run the Mini Roos program for boys and girls aged between 5 and 9.  

Off the field, we have also made huge strides. Thanks to grants from the Communities Sports Infrastructure (Federal government) and Get Going Playing and Spaces (Qld government) we were able to do a massive field upgrade involving the erection of perimeter fencing and a total re-laying of our playing surface. Both of these upgrades were ready for the start of the 2020 season.  

We also undertook significant clubhouse modifications which largely involved the erection of 2 new dressing rooms and a disabled toilet. This was proudly funded by the Building Stronger Communities grant from Brisbane City Council.  

While 2020 was the year of Covid, we were able to emerge largely unscathed, thanks to assistance
from the Lord Mayor’s Covid Assistance grant and the State government Active Restart Infrastructure
Recovery Fund.  

2021 promises to be the best year yet- with the excellent off-work work, we are now focusing attention
on making Prentice Park one of the great community sporting hubs. For the first time we will be offering football playing opportunities from “cradle to grave”, starting with our Mini Roos, through to
Senior Men and Women and then Over 30s and 45s for women and men respectively.
