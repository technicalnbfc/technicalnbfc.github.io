We offer the best value for money Registration fees in the Football Brisbane competition. Why can we do this? We can do this because we have a hard-working group of volunteers- groundsmen, canteen operators, cleaners, facilities operations, coaches, managers and sports trainers- who put in a huge amount of volunteer time which in turn saves enormous amounts of money for our club. 

We are also fortunate to have a core group of sponsors who assist us greatly with our bottom line and thus subsidise to some extent the cost of registration. Then there is our partnership with QUT FC/Sport. They provide a significant proportion of our total playing numbers and directly subsidise their members when it comes to the payment of registration fees, thus ensuring that for those people, their fees are reduced even further.  

As we enter into our sixth year as a Football Brisbane club, we are committed to providing quality football services to our players at budget rates.  

__Registration Fees__  
* Senior Mens and Womens Capital League and City Divisions - __Total Cost $530__  
* $30 discount applies if full payment is made by the end of February
* QUT Students will recieve a further subsidy of $50 off their fees  
* A loyalty discount of $50 is available for players who have been with the club for five years or more  

This covers:
* All FFA, Football Queensland and Football Brisbane fees
* Access to the FFA Insurance Scheme
* Referee's fees for all games (pre-season, cups and fixtures)
* Supply of playing strip and shorts (plain white socks not included but available for purchase from the club)
* Club polo for you to keep (or club training shirt if you already have a club polo)
* Access once a week to a qualified Physiotherapist to assess any injury and access to their clinic if follow-up treatment is required
* Sports Trainer coverage on match day to assist with strapping, massage, injury management etc. (Capital League teams only)
* A customary post game snack at home games
* Access to training facilities and all associated equipment twice a week for the duration of the season (once a week for some City Division teams)
* Access to high competent coaches and their assistants for the duration of the season


__Payment of Fees__  
North Brisbane FC recognises that for a number of our players, particularly university students, finding all the money up-front to pay fees can be quite a challenge. Consequently, anyone who is experiencing financial hardship, can apply to the Treasurer to enter into a payment plan. However, before any player will be allowed to play in a fixture match, they must have paid at least 50% of their fee and have a payment plan in place for the balance that is owed.  
Please note there is a $30 discount for full payment of fees by the end of February 2020.
  

__How to Register__  
All registrations are done online. Go to the Play Football website and click on register and nominate North Brisbane FC as your club. From there just follow the prompts. If you experience difficulties registering contact us via our Facebook page for further assistance.
  

__How to Pay__  
We recommend that players do not pay through the FFA online Payment system. Rather, we recommend you click on “Manual Payment to club” when registering online and pay via the following options:
* Direct Credit to club account. BSB: 064114; Account Number: 10252266 (Commbank)
* EFTPOS at club (you can pay using your credit card under this option without any added fee).
* Cash directly to club Treasurer.
  

__Refunds__  
North Brisbane FC, like other Football Brisbane clubs, does not generally provide refunds to players unless they request de-registration prior to playing a fixture match. In these cases, a full amount of refund will be given, less a $50 administration and training fee.
Once a player has played a fixture match, no refunds will generally be made. That is because the Registration fee covers a range of “sunk” costs which the club still incurs even if a player ceases to play.
The Treasurer may in exceptional circumstances decide to refund registration fees in whole or in part.
Where a player is allowed to pay in instalments, the full amount of the registration fee is owing once the player has played at least one fixture match. Where a player decides to cease playing before the full fee is paid, the balance is still owing and payment of the debt will be pursued if necessary (ultimately at the player’s cost) through QCAT.
  

__Volunteering and Player Expectations__  
As a smaller club, we do not mandate volunteer levies or rosters.
However, like other clubs, we are always in need of volunteers to cover a range of duties such as team managers, coaches, canteen, grounds, working bees, fundraisers etc. We therefore have an expectation that players will assist the club in some way during the year, even if only for a few hours.
Like any club, there will be those who will do more than their share and others who will do less. However, we’d like to see a more balanced effort between players and supporters this year.
The committee puts in a huge amount of volunteer work around the club but they can’t and shouldn’t always be the ones to do it all. No committee person gets paid a cent for their efforts - they do it to help the club and importantly keep player costs down.
Lastly, as a club our fundraising strategy has consisted of Bunnings BBQ days and our annual Trivia Night which has become quite the occasion. There is a clear expectation that players attend at least our annual Trivia night (only cost $15 and you get a great feed).
