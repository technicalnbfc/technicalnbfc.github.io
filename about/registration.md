We offer the best value for money Registration fees in the Football Brisbane competition. Why can we do this? We can do this because we have a hard-working group of volunteers- groundsmen, canteen operators, cleaners, facilities operations, coaches, managers and sports trainers- who put in a huge amount of volunteer time which in turn saves enormous amounts of money for our club.  

We are also fortunate to have a core group of sponsors who assist us greatly with our bottom line and thus subsidise to some extent the cost of registration. Then there is our partnership with QUT FC/Sport which provide a significant proportion of our total playing numbers  thus ensuring that for those people, their fees are reduced even further. 

As we enter into our sixth year as a re-birthed Football Brisbane club, we are committed to providing quality football services to our players at budget rates.

* Senior Mens and Womens Capital League and City Divisions - __Total Cost $530__

* Access to highly competent coaches and their assistants for the duration of the season


__Payment of Fees__  
North Brisbane FC recognises that for a number of our players, particularly university students, finding all the money up-front to pay fees can be quite a challenge. Consequently, anyone who is experiencing financial hardship, can apply to the Treasurer to enter into a payment plan. However, before any player will be allowed to play in a fixture match, they must have paid at least 50% of their fee and have a payment plan in place for the balance that is owed.  
Please note there is a $30 discount for full payment of fees by the end of February 2020 ($500 total payment).
  

__How to Register__  
All registrations are done online. Go to the Play Football website and click on register and nominate North Brisbane FC as your club. From there just follow the prompts. If you experience difficulties registering contact us via our Facebook page for further assistance.
  

__How to Pay__  
Players can choose to pay through the FFA online Payment system. If doing so, you need to pay the entire amount of $530 (or $500 if you pay on or before the end of February 2020). Note that for the 2020 season, the credit card charge is 1.1% of the online payment.  

Players can also choose to pay their fees directly to the club. You can do this by choosing the “Offline Payment to Club” feature when registering online and pay via the following options:  
* Direct Credit to club account. BSB: 064114; Account Number: 10252266 (Commbank)
* EFTPOS at club (you can pay using your credit card under this option without any added fee).
* Cash directly to club Treasurer.  
* _For players who are looking to pay via an instalment plan or who qualify for a QUT or loyalty discount, you need to click on “Offline Payment” to club._  

__Refunds__  
North Brisbane FC, like other Football Brisbane clubs, does not generally provide refunds to players unless they request de-registration prior to playing a fixture match. In these cases, a refund of the club component of the fee will be given, less a $50 administration fee and a pre-season training/playing fee of $50 per month.

This same refund approach will be applied to all players this year due to the effects of COVID-19, irrespective of whether you have played a fixture or cup match (some Capital League players may be in this position).   

The other component of a player's registration fee is the governing body fee. For the 2020 year, that amount is $198. The Refund Policy for this component of the fee can be found on the Football Queensland website:

www.footballqueensland.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FQ-Refund-Policy-2020.pdf

While players may request a refund in exceptional circumstances, essentially the policy provides that once a player has participated in any form of pre-season training and/or games, they are not entitled to a refund of the governing body fees.  

Where a player is allowed to pay in instalments, the full amount of the registration fee is owing once the player has played at least one fixture match. Where a player decides to cease playing before the full fee is paid, the balance is still owing and payment of the debt will be pursued if necessary (ultimately at the player’s cost) through QCAT.
  
For any refund enquiries please contact the [club Treasurer](../about/committee).
  

__Volunteering and Player Expectations__  
As a smaller club, we do not mandate volunteer levies or rosters.
However, like other clubs, we are always in need of volunteers to cover a range of duties such as team managers, coaches, canteen, grounds, working bees, fundraisers etc.  

The committee puts in a huge amount of volunteer work around the club but they can’t and shouldn’t always be the ones to do it all, especially with the increase in the expected number of teams for 2020.

No committee person gets paid a cent for their efforts - they do it to help the club and importantly keep player costs down. To help keep these costs down, we expect to see every player contribute a few hours of their time at least once during the year.  

Lastly, as a club our fundraising strategy has consisted of Bunnings BBQ days and our annual Trivia Night which has become quite the occasion. There is a clear expectation that players attend at least our annual Trivia night (only cost $20 and you get a great feed).
