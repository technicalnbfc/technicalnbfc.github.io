In 2021, we ran the successful Mini Roos Kick off Program with over 40 kids during terms 2, 3 and 4.  

For 2022, we plan to run a number of Mini Roos teams in Football Queensland competition for the first time, including:
- 3 or 4 Under 6 and 7 teams (mixed)
- 2 x Under 8/9 teams (one male and one female)
- 2 x Under 10-12 teams (one male, one female)

Mini Roos will likely train on Tuesday afternoons from 4- 5 pm and play on Saturday mornings. Fixtures start on Saturday 23 April and conclude on Saturday 10 September (there are breaks for school holidays).  

Registration fees are $330 for kids aged 5-7 and $350 for 8-12 year-olds. These are great value fees as they cover all your costs and the kids get a playing strip, shorts and socks.  

Our first Mini Roos Muster/sign-on day will be Saturday 5 March 2022 at 9 am.  

Places are limited as we need to place our existing Mini Roos players and we have limited field space.  

To register your interest, please complete the form below and indicate your childâ€™s name and date of birth. Any queries, feel free to contact our Mini Roos Co-ordinator Greg Vitulano on 0437320107 or via email on [treasurer@northbrisbanefc.com.au](treasurer@northbrisbanefc.com.au).  

We will also continue with our Mini Roos Kick off Program on a smaller scale on Tuesday afternoons as well.
