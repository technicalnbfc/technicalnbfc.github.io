__Capital League__

Fresh from a third-placed finish in Capital div 1 last year, our top senior women’s team are aiming to go one better this year and secure promotion to the Mt Franklin’s Women’s Brisbane Premier league.  

We are also fielding a Capital league Reserve team this year.
Training for our Capital League squad is on every Monday at Prentice Park and Wednesday at Kedron AFL, Sixth Avenue Kedron from 7 pm to 8.30 pm.  

__City League__

In addition to our Capital League side, we are likely to have 2 City League sides in divs 4 and 5.  

Training for our City League players commences on Wednesday 23 January from 7pm to 8.30 pm at Kedron AFL, Sixth Avenue Kedron.  

Anyone interested in playing either Capital or City League - send us a message via Facebook or contact the women’s Director of Coaching Greg Vitulano at treasurer@northbrisbanefc.com.au or by phone on 0437 320 107.
