__Capital League__

This year we will field a firsts and reserves team in the Capital League Division 1 competition. Training for our Capital League squad is on every Monday at Prentice Park and Wednesday at Kedron AFL, Sixth Avenue Kedron from 7 pm to 8.30 pm. However, for the month of January while Prentice Park is getting upgraded, training will be at Kedron AFL both days, starting Monday 6 January at 7 pm.  

Players are always welcome to come down and trial - send us a message via Facebook or contact our head coach Fiore Bartilomo on 0403 511 853 or via email at fiorebartilomo@bigpond.com.  

__City League__

In addition to our Capital League side, we are likely to have 2 City League sides in divs 4 and 5.  

Training for our City League players commences on Wednesday 22 January 2020 from 7pm to 8.30 pm at Kedron AFL, Sixth Avenue Kedron.  

For the first time we will also be fielding a team in the Over 30s competition. While the standard is still relatively high, it is suited to players who are looking at a more manageable playing pace. Note that a special fee of $330 (including a club polo) applies to players looking to play in this competition.  

Anyone interested in playing either City League or Women’s Over 30s - send us a message via Facebook or contact the senior women’s co-ordinator  Greg Vitulano at treasurer@northbrisbanefc.com.au or by phone on 0437 320 107. Alternatively, you can contact Janette Murphy for Over 30s (jmmurpy@hotmail.com).
