__Men’s FQPL 2022__  
After the massively successful “double double”- premiers and champions- by both our Capital League Div 2 Firsts and Reserves in 2021- we are promoted to the newly-named FQPL div 4 competition in 2022.  

Training is on every Tuesday and Thursday from 7 pm onwards at Prentice Park (note we’ll be training at Norths Rugby on Wednesday 5 January, Monday 10 January and Wednesday 12 January- all at 7 pm- while Prentice Park is being top-dressed).  

Players are always welcome to come down and trial - send us a message below or via Facebook or contact our head coach Anj Sandhar on 0422 330 430 or via email at anjiaman11@gmail.com.  

__Metro (formerly City)  League__  
With some of our older brigade moving into Over 35s, we are looking to field 3 teams in the Metro League competition - likely to be in Divs 4, , 6, 7 and 8.  

Training/trials for all teams will commence on Wednesday 2 February  from 7 pm onwards at Kedron AFL, Sixth Avenue Kedron and take place every Wednesday thereafter.  

Spots are limited but any interested players - send us a message below or via Facebook or contact Chris Tully via email on cvtully11@outlook.com.  

__Over 35s__  
We are also fielding an Over 35s team in 2022- made up largely of our ageing City div players. As with Metro divs, training will take place every Wednesday from 7pm at Kedron AFL.  

Any interested players - send us a message below or contact Chris Tully via email on <cvtully11@outlook.com>.
