__Senior Men's Capital League:__

__Head coach:__ Anj Sandhar  
Anj has coached the top men’s team since we returned to Football Brisbane competition in 2015. Last year the team finished a creditable fifth in their second season in the higher division. Bolstered by some quality off-season signings, Anj is aiming for a top-four finish this year.  

__Assistant Coach and Capital League Reserves:__ Thomas Connolly  
Tom “draw” Connolly had a creditable first year in charge of the Capital League Reserves side in 2019, finishing mid-table. The finish would undoubtedly have been higher but for a spate of draws that should have been converted into wins. That followed on from his debut coaching season where he guided our men’s City div 3 team to a creditable top 4 finish in 2018. Early signs are encouraging, with Tom also confident of a top 4 finish in 2020.  

__Div 4:__ TBA  
This team were relegated from division 3 in 2019 but with the incredible depth looming for the senior men’s program in 2020 will likely be a much-changed side. Though not confirmed, rumour has it that former div 7 coach Carlo Borzellega will guide this team in 2020.  

__Div 5:__ TBA  

__Div 6:__ Zach King, Andy Hearne, James Somers  
This triumvirate of player coaches will saddle up again to guide their chargers who  made the div 7 grand final but fell to eventual champions Caboolture. They won’t be able to beat the handicapper’s axe this time around so a stint in div 6 looms for another of our club’s likeable teams in 2020.  

__Div 7:__ Duncan Campbell  
Duncan returns for a second season in charge of one of our Citry div teams, having had mixed success with last year’s relegated Div 6 team.  With better luck with injuries and signings, a successful season is around the corner for this likeable club team.

__Senior Women's Capital League:__

__Head Coach:__ Fiore Bartilomo  
Fiore joins the club this year, having been the NPL assistant coach at Mitchelton in 2019. He brings with him that high-level experience, as well as junior coaching experience of many years at Albany Creek. Having already signed a number of excellent players in the off-season, hopes are high for a top 4 finish and a promotion push back to the BWPL competition in 2021.  

__Assistant Coach:__ Lino Del Vecchio.  
Lino first became involved in the women’s program in 2016 as a strength and conditioning/sports trainer and has been the first team assistant coach for the past 2 years.  He is greatly respected for his commitment, professionalism and forthright nature.  

__Capital League Reserves:__ Jason Foo  
Jason takes on the reins of the Ressies for the second year running and is part of the Capital League coaching team. Jason came to the club from Centenary in 2019, having taken that team to a place in the City div 3 grand final in 2018. In a tough 2019 season in the BWPL, Jason achieved some outstanding results with his squad and will be looking to consolidate that learning in the more sedentary pace of the capital League competition in 2020. 

__Assistant Capital League Reserves:__ Steph “the Juggler” Tartan  
Steph (aka the juggle queen) is a player of great repute who suffered an awful injury in 2019 and so is turning her attention to coaching in 2020. Steph possesses an acute football brain and is very willing to learn (having already completed a community coaching certificate course).  We look forward to her developing into an astute coach as the season goes on.  

__Div 4:__ Advan Catakovic  
Advan is another North Brisbane old boy who did a great job leading the girls to the grand final in 2019. With the core of that squad back again in 2020, Advan is looking to go one better. As a former striker of considerable repute, you can be sure that Advan will have his girls firing home from all angles.  

__Assistant Div 4:__ Anthony Napoli  
Another North Brisbane old boy, Anthony first coached the women’s div 4 team with great distinction in 2017, just missing out on a spot in the grand final. He returns this year to support his old forward partner Advan. The div 4 girls are indeed blessed to have 2 coaches with such wonderful coaching experience and background.  

__Div 5:__ TBA  

__Over 30s:__ Janette Murphy  
Long-time club identity Janette Murphy will guide the over 30s women’s team in 2020. Janette first donned the red and white of North Brisbane in 1989 and so is probably, along with sister Joanne, the longest-serving player at the club. This team is a bit of a reunion of sorts for the North Brisbane Church League team. Great to see.   

__Women’s Co-ordinator:__ Greg Vitulano  
With the number of teams stretching to 5 this year, Greg is taking a step back from his Director of Coaching role to take on the role of co-ordinator for the women’s program.

__Club Support Staff:__     

__Club Physio:__ Bill Ingledew.  
Principal of 4tfi physiotherapy, Bill re-joins our team this year, having been a player of some repute during our club’s halycon days in the top division in the early to mid 1990s. Someone from his clinic will be down once a week to triage player injuries. His clinic can be found at Cardigan house, Sandgate Road Nundah. We urge all club players and supporters to choose 4tfi as their preferred physio supplier.  

__Sports trainers:__ TBA    

__Goalkeeper Coach:__ Wayne Evans.  
Wayne is another of the North Brisbane alumni coaching at the club after a first successful stint last year. Wayne played in the old National Soccer league as a keeper and had local first division experience, mostly with North Brisbane and Brisbane City. He also served as a goalkeeper coach at Rochedale Rovers with distinction for a number of years. We are indeed fortunate to have Wayne on board again this year.
