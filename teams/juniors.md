Our commitment as a club to women’s football is being strengthened. In addition to fielding 5 senior women’s teams and 2 Mini Roos all female teams (Under 9s and 12s), we are aiming to field 2 junior girls teams in Football Queensland competition in 2022 for the first time.  

We are particularly looking to recruit players aged between 13-15 in 2022 (born 2007-2009).  

Our program offers:
- Quality coaching twice a week, with emphasis on skills and team development

- Excellent fees- $450- which covers everything (no additional game day fees) and you get a full kit to keep- club polo, playing strip, shorts and socks.
