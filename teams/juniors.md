In 2020, we ran the Mini Roos Kick off Program. While this program will be offered again this year, we are also looking to run a number of Mini Roos teams in Football Brisbane competition for the first time.  

MIni Roos will run from Saturday 6 March at 9.00 am through to early September. Registration fees are $330 for kids aged 5-7 and $350 for 8s and 9s. These are great value fees for this age group.  

To register your interest, please message us on our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/northbrisbanefc/) page North Brisbane FC or contact our Mini Roos Co-ordinator Greg Vitulano on [0437 320 107](tel:0437320107) or via email at <treasurer@northbrisbanefc.com.au>.  

We will also continue with our Mini Roos Kick off Program which will start in term 2. More details about this to follow.
