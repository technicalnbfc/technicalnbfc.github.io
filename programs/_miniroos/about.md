North Brisbane FC is part of the Mini Roos football program run by Football Federation Australia (FFA), which is a modified form of the world game and is specifically designed to increase player participation and enjoyment.

MiniRoos Club Football uses small, sided games (4v4, 7v7 & 9v9) rather than the traditional 11v11 format to cater to 4â€“12-year-olds. The smaller fields, modified rules and fewer players mean a more enjoyable game with more opportunities to touch the ball and more opportunities to score goals, once again increasing the likelihood of an overall positive experience.

As your child progresses through the various age groups, they will be introduced to playing environments that most suite their stage of development and prepare them for the transition to 11v11 football when the time comes. Smaller teams (and field size) increase the number of touches on the ball. It's more fun!
