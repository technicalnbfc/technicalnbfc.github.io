##### Kangaroo Competition

The Kangaroo competition is a skills-based program and where a team qualifies for placement in the Kangaroo competition, additional training days will be run throughout the course of the season with a development coach.

The higher fee covers the cost of additional field usage and development coach input.

Placement in the Kangaroo competition will be on a **team basis only** and nomination will be determined solely by the Junior Committee.
