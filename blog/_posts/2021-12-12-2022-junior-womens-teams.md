Our commitment as a club to women’s football is being strengthened. In addition to fielding 5 senior women’s teams and 2 Mini Roos all female teams (Under 9s and 12s), we are aiming to field 2 junior girls teams in Football Queensland competition in 2022 for the first time.

We are particularly looking to recruit players aged between 13-15 in 2022 (born 2007-2009).

Our program offers:

- Quality coaching twice a week, with emphasis on skills and team development
- Holistic learning environment- where we look to develop young women, not just young footballers.
- Excellent fees- $450- which covers everything (no additional game day fees) and you get a full kit to keep- club polo, playing strip, shorts and socks.

Keep an eye out for our come and try day on Saturday 29 January at 9.30 a.m.
