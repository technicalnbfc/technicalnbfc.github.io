If your child wants to give soccer a go this season, we're running Come & Try sessions through February. These are open to beginners and kids who've played before.

We have teams for boys and girls across all age groups, including girls-only teams.

##### Session times:

**Tuesdays – 10, 17, 24 February & 3 March:**
- Under 5, 6, 7 and 8: 4.30pm – 5.20pm
- Under 9 and 10: 5.30pm – 6.30pm

**Wednesdays – 11, 18, 25 February & 4 March:**
- Under 11, 12, 13 and 14: 5.30pm – 6.30pm

All sessions are at **Prentice Park, Thistle St, Lutwyche**.

New and returning players are welcome. 

If you're not sure whether your child will take to it, just bring them along and see how they go.

If you are returning for the season you can register ahead of the come and try days.
