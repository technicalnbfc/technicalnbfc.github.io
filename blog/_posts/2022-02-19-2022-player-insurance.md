post_lead: All players who register for North Brisbane FC are entitled to access the FFA Insurance Scheme. This scheme essentially provides for capital, loss of income and non-medicare expense outlays incurred by players in the event of injury. By far the most common claim is for out of pocket physiotherapy and dental costs associated with injuries while playing/training for the club. Under the scheme, players are entitled to 85% of their out of pocket expenses less a $50 excess per injury.

All players who register for North Brisbane FC are entitled to access the FFA Insurance Scheme. This scheme essentially provides for capital, loss of income and non-medicare expense outlays incurred by players in the event of injury.

By far the most common claim is for out of pocket physiotherapy and dental costs associated with injuries while playing/training for the club. Under the scheme, players are entitled to 85% of their out of pocket expenses less a $50 excess per injury.

**Example:**

Bill is injured during a game with a severe ankle sprain. He visits a physiotherapist a number of times in relation to that injury and is out of pocket a total of $450. Under the scheme, he is entitled to 85% of those costs, less the $50 excess. This results in Bill receiving $340 back from insurance.

To assist players to receive proper and effective injury treatment, we have once again partnered with 4tfi Physiotherapy for 2021, who will triage and assess injured players and, if necessary, provide further treatment at their clinic. They are our preferred physio supplier so we urge club members to utilise their services. They can also assist with the claims process.

With any claim you need a doctor’s referral and they also need to complete an “Attending Physician” statement. As such, we strongly urge you to visit your doctor and get their referral as soon as possible after the injury.

Claim Forms can be accessed via the Claims Portal which can be found on the [Gow Gates Sport](https://football.gowgatessport.com.au/welcome/) website.

**Completed forms should be sent to [info@northbrisbanefc.com.au](info@northbrisbanefc.com.au).**

Any queries, please direct them to the club Treasurer.
