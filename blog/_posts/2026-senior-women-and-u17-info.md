#### FQPL Div 2

Our FQPL squad are looking to rejuvenate after a difficult season in  Div 1 in 2025. Our head coaches Sam Silva (Firsts) and Jeremy Medina (Under 23s) are assembling an excellent squad with a focus on commitment and player development. They will be ably supported by the FQPL coaching team of Cooper Kennedy, Advan Catakovic and Lino Del Vecchio.

Training for our FQPL Div 2 squad is on every Monday and Wednesday at Prentice Park from 6.45 pm sharp to 8.30 pm, starting Monday 5 January and continuing throughout the season.
