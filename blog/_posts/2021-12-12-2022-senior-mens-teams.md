**Men’s FQPL 2022**  
After the massively successful “double double” - premiers and champions- by both our Capital League Div 2 Firsts and Reserves in 2021- we are promoted to the newly-named FQPL div 4 competition in 2022.

Training is on every Tuesday and Thursday from 7 pm onwards at Prentice Park (note we’ll be training at Norths Rugby on Wednesday 5 January, Monday 10 January and Wednesday 12 January- all at 7 pm- while Prentice Park is being top-dressed).

Players are always welcome to come down and trial - send us a message below or via Facebook or contact our head coach Anj Sandhar on 0422 330 430 or via email at [anjiaman11@gmail.com](anjiaman11@gmail.com).

**Metro (formerly City) League**  
With some of our older brigade moving into Over 35s, we are looking to field 3 teams in the Metro League competition - likely to be in Divs 4, 6, 7 or 8.

Training/trials for all teams will commence on Wednesday 2 February from 7 pm onwards at Kedron AFL, Sixth Avenue Kedron and take place every Wednesday thereafter.

Spots are limited but any interested players - send us a message below or via Facebook or contact Chris Tully via email at [cvtully11@outlook.com](cvtully11@outlook.com).

**Over 35s**  
We are also fielding an Over 35s team in 2022- made up largely of our ageing City div players. As with Metro divs, training will take place every Wednesday from 7pm at Kedron AFL.

Any interested players - send us a message below or contact Chris Tully via email at [cvtully11@outlook.com](cvtully11@outlook.com).
