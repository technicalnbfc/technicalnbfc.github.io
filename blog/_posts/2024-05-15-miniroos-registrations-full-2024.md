post_lead: North Brisbane FC's popular 2024 Miniroos program is full, but stay tuned for future programs and opportunities!
---

Due to overwhelming demand, our 2024 Miniroos program is now at capacity and we are therefore no longer able to accept registrations.

We've been astounded by the immense interest and enthusiasm shown for this year's Miniroos program. The response from the community has been truly remarkable. Unfortunately, as much as we would love to accommodate every eager player, our capacity is finite, and we have now reached that limit.

We want to extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who has shown interest in joining the North Brisbane FC Miniroos program this year. Your enthusiasm and support mean the world to us.

Although registrations for this season are closed, we encourage you to stay connected with North Brisbane FC. Keep an eye on our [website](https://www.northbrisbanefc.com.au/index.html) and follow our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/northbrisbanefc/) for updates on future programs, events, and opportunities to get involved. We're always looking for ways to engage with our community, and we hope to welcome you back in the future.
