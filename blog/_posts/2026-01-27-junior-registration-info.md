#### North Brisbane FC MiniRoos Registrations - 2026 Season

North Brisbane FC is excited to open up registrations across our Miniroos boys and girls community teams for the 2026 season in the following age groups:

- U5 & U6/7 (born 2019, 2020, 2021)
- U8 (born 2018)
- U9 (born 2017)
- U10 (born 2016)
- U11 (born 2015)
- U12 (born 2014)

##### Registration Process

In 2026, all registrations and payments must be done online via [Squadi](https://registration.squadi.com/login) and [PlayFootball](https://playfootball.com.au/home).

Our club details in Squadi are:

- Postcode: 4030
- Organisation name: North Brisbane FC
- Competition: Metro MiniRoos and U12
- Age groups: Quokka and Wallaby (for under 9 and above)

If you are new and don’t have a Squadi or Playfootball profile, you need to create one and complete all the relevant details about yourself and then pay at the end to complete your registration. 

Make sure you complete your registration firstly in Playfootball. For children born in 2018 and earlier, you will need to pay a fee of $18 to Football Australia. It is free for children born in 2019 and later but you still need to register them via that platform. 

Total fees (payable across both Squadi and Playfootball) are based on age group and competition and for community teams per child range from:

- $455 (Under 5-7)
- $493 (Under 8-11)
- $513 (U 12) 

Children who play in Kangaroo/Bilbys competitions pay a bit more due to the extra services offered. We will notify you if your child participates in one of these competitions and provide you with the information to complete your registration.

You can elect to play your fees by instalment.  

A $50 discount is available for each successive sibling. 

Play On vouchers are also acceptable. Round 2 opens up on 29 January 2026. When you go to pay in Squadi, it will ask if you have a Play On Voucher. If you do, record the voucher number and it will reduce your fee by $200. 

The above fees are inclusive of everything-trainings and match days over Terms 2 and 3 -  you just need to buy boots and shin pads for your child. We also supply each child with club socks, shorts, a playing shirt and a trophy at year-end.
