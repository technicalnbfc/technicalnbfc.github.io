Training sessions will generally be held for one hour between 4pm and 6.30 pm on weekdays during the school term, with the exact training schedule to be communicated once team numbers are finalized.

#### Games

Games are played on Saturday mornings. For our U5-7 age group, in 2024 North Brisbane and Newmarket will join forces to run U6 and U7 competitions between the two Clubs. The competition will largely remain the same, with games held on Saturday mornings at McCook Pk, Newmarket as well, at Prentice Park, Lutwyche. This will give our young players more teams to play and get a taste of playing home and away for the Club.

U8-U12 will play home & away fixtures within the general north Brisbane region. No games are played, or training scheduled during school holidays. Scheduling for games will be communicated once finalized by Football Queensland, with all fixture information available in the SQUADI app.
We look forward to seeing you at one or all of our come and try days. Our Coaches and Junior Committee will be available to answer any questions you may have.
