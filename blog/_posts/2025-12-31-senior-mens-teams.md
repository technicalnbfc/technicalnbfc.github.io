#### Men’s FQPL 2026   

Our FQPL Firsts and Under 23s are looking to build on an excellent end of season finish in 2025.

Under the guidance of long-standing head coach Anj Sandhar and Under 23s coach Kale Boone, the men’s FQPL program is looking to improve on last year’s finishing positions and develop our next generation of NBFC players. 

Training is on every Tuesday and Thursday from 6.45 pm onwards at Prentice Park, starting Tuesday 6 January. 

Players are always welcome to come down and trial - contact our head coach Anj Sandhar on 0422 330 430 or via email at [fqplmen@northbrisbanefc.com.au](mailto:fqplmen@northbrisbanefc.com.au?subject=Senior%20Mens%20Football).
