post_lead: In 2022 we successfully ran 9 teams (under 7s, 9s and 12s) in FQ Mini Roos Competition for the first time in over 30 years. This year we plan to slightly extend the number of MiniRoos but spaces are somewhat limited. Registration fees are $380 for under 5-7; $400 for under 8-12 and $420 for Under 13s. They cover all training sessions, game fees and include a playing strip, shorts, socks and a medallion.

In 2022 we successfully ran 9 teams (under 7s, 9s and 12s) in FQ Mini Roos Competition for the first time in over 30 years. In all we had around 70 registered players.

For 2023, we plan extend our MiniRoo base including:

- 8 x Under 6 and 7 teams (mixed- games to be played in-house)
- 4 x Under 8/9 teams (mixed and female)
- 3 x Under 10-12 teams (mixed and female)
- 1 x Under 13 team (mixed)
- Includes development teams under the guidance of Jake Goodship (FIFA pro-licence candidate and former head coach of Brisbane Roar a-league women's team)

Mini Roos will likely train on Wednesday afternoons from 5- 6 pm at Prentice Park and play on Saturday mornings. Fixtures start on Saturday 22 April and conclude on Saturday 9 September (there are breaks for school holidays).

Registration fees are $380 for kids aged 5-7, $400 for 8-12 year-olds and $420 for Under 13s. They cover all your costs and the kids get a playing strip, shorts, socks and end of year medallion. All teams will have a community-qualified coach.

If your child is playing for the first time and you're not sure how they'll go, we will have a number of Come and Try days to sort out our teams prior to the start of fixtures. Our Mini Roos Come and Try days will run over 5 Saturday mornings (9-10 am at Prentice), starting on 25 February and ending on 25 March (last week before the Easter break). Wednesday training for teams will start on 19 April and run every week till 6 September (school holidays excluded)

Places are limited as we need to place our existing Mini Roos players and we have limited field space.
