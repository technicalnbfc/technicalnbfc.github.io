**Under 18 Boys**

For the first time in the club's history, we are looking to field an Under 18 boys (mixed) team in FQ Community Competition. We are very close to forming a team but are on the look-out for a few players to complete the squad.

The team will train once a week on a Wednesday at Kedron AFL, Sixth Avenue Kedron from 7 pm to 8.30 pm, starting 17 January.

Fees are $550. This covers everything (no additional game day fees) and you get shorts, socks and a club polo to keep (playing strip is supplied).

Anyone interested, please message us using the form below (please enter your name, age, playing history and preferred playing position) or contact Greg Vitulano at [treasurer@northbrisbanefc.com.au](treasurer@northbrisbanefc.com.au)

**Under 15 Girls**

Our commitment as a club to women’s football continues to strengthen. In addition to fielding 5 senior women’s teams and 4 Mini Roos all female teams (Under 9s to 13s), we are aiming to field an Under 15 Girls team in Football Queensland Community Competition in 2024.

We are particularly looking to recruit players aged between 13-15 in 2024 (born 2009-2011).

Our program offers:

- Quality coaching twice a week, with emphasis on skills and team development
- Holistic learning environment- where we look to develop young women, not just young footballers.
- Excellent fees- $530- which covers everything (no additional game day fees) and you get a full kit to keep- club polo, playing strip, shorts and socks.

Please submit your Expression of Interest using the form below; key details to include are your name, age, playing history and preferred playing position.
