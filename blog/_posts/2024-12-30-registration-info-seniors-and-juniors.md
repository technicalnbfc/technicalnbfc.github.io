NBFC offers good value for money registration fees. We can do this because we have a hard-working group of volunteers- groundsmen, cleaners, facilities operations, coaches, managers and sports trainers- who put in a huge amount of volunteer time which in turn saves enormous amounts of money for our club.

However, our volunteer base is not limitless. To reduce volunteer burnout, some of our operations have been out-sourced at a cost to the organisation, either in terms of additional fixed overheads or a reduction in operational revenue.

Our fees for 2025 have been set with these factors in mind.

##### How to Register and Pay

All registrations and payments are to be done online via [Squadi](https://registration.squadi.com/login) AND Playfootball.  

Squadi is to be used to pay your club fees and a governing body fee of $130 to Football Queensland ($65 for Metro Juniors)..Note you need to create a profile in Squadi before you can proceed to register.

Playfootball is used to pay your governing body fee of $35 to Football Australia ($15 for metro Junior players). Once you complete your registration in Squadi, a link to Playfootball will appear. Click on the link and proceed to register and pay via Playfootball.

Your registration cannot be activated until you pay the fees applicable in both Squadi **and** Playfootball..

Just remember that the club is North Brisbane FC and that you do not need to enter your FFA ID.

**Please ensure that you register under the correct Competition Package.**

Metro Community Seniors men and women- please register under that category.
The same applies to players who have been offered positions in the Men’s and Women’s FQPL programs.

You can pay in Squadi either via debit/credit card or via a bank transfer so please have that info ready when you register.

We encourage our members to pay their fees in full and by 14 February to take advantage of the $30 Early Bird discount (this discount is only available to Senior players).

However, for those with financial difficulties, Squadi offers an instalment plan as follows: the amount of the governing body fee  at the time of registration and then 5 equal payments, payable on the 14th day of February, March, April, May and June

If you register after 14 February but before 14 March, the first instalment  will be added to the second instalment so that you will always pay your final instalment on the 14th day of June.

Note there are no other instalment/payment plans available.

###### Discounts

To give effect to our discounts for Early Bird payment, Full-time students and 5-year Loyalty, you will need to insert a Discount Code into Squadi. When you go to register and pay, Squadi will ask you to enter any Discount Code applicable.

For the Early Bird Discount, the code is Early Bird (applicable for payments in full made on or before 14 February)

For the Full-time Tertiary student, the code is FT Tertiary Student

For the 5-Year Loyalty, the code is Loyalty.

**Remember: All registrations and payments to be made online via Squadi (club plus FQ governing body fee) and Playfootball (FA governing body fee).
Any questions regarding registration fees and amounts please contact [treasurer@northbrisbanefc.com.au](mailto:treasurer@northbrisbanefc.com.au).

###### Refunds

There are two components of the registration fee. The governing body fee ($165 for seniors and $81 for juniors for both the FQ and FA components) and a club fee for the balance.

North Brisbane FC, like most Football Queensland clubs, does not generally provide refunds to players for their club fee  unless they request de-registration prior to playing a fixture match.

In these cases, a refund of the club component of the fee will be given, less a $50 administration fee and a pre-season training/playing fee of $50 per month. If merchandise (polo, shorts and socks) has already been provided the player is required to return that merchandise or have a further $50 deducted to cover that cost.

Any refunds to be given to a player who ceases to play after the start of the fixture season depends on the relevant circumstances. The starting point is that refunds are generally not given due to the sunk costs involved once a player has registered and played games.  

The other component of a player’s registration fee is the governing body fee. For the 2025 year, that amount is $165 for Seniors. Note that refund of this component of the registration fee is done pursuant to the FQ Refund Policy, i.e. we as a club do not have any control over that
While players may request a refund in exceptional circumstances, essentially the FQ policy provides that once a player has participated in any form of pre-season training and/or games, they are not entitled to a refund of the governing body fees.

**Important** Where a player is allowed to pay in instalments, the full amount of the registration fee is owing, even if a player decides they do not wish to play anymore.

For any refund enquiries please contact the treasurer via email [treasurer@northbrisbanefc.com.au](mailto:treasurer@northbrisbanefc.com.au).

##### Volunteering and Player Expectations

As a smaller club, we do not mandate volunteer levies or rosters. However, like other clubs, we are always in need of volunteers to cover a range of duties such as team managers, coaches, grounds, match day officials, working bees, fundraisers etc.

The committee puts in a huge amount of volunteer work around the club but they can’t and shouldn’t always be the ones to do it all, especially with the number of players at the club in 2025. So please offer your services to help out with even the most basic of tasks on game day.
