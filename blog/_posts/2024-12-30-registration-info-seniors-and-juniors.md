NBFC offers good value for money registration fees. We can do this because we have a hard-working group of volunteers- groundsmen, cleaners, facilities operations, coaches, managers and sports trainers- who put in a huge amount of volunteer time which in turn saves enormous amounts of money for our club.

However, our volunteer base is not limitless. To reduce volunteer burnout, some of our operations have been out-sourced at a cost to the organisation, either in terms of additional fixed overheads or a reduction in operational revenue.

Our fees for 2025 have been set with these factors in mind.
